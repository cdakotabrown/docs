<big><big>A lot of this WIP currently comes from the pinned docs in the Tsurugi channel of the discord. Here's one: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnygDWOVxDKjpY96jct4RqCtv3ugzeSgDzDxc-pN7Yc '''RedSlasher's Tsurugi combo doc'''].</big></big>

==Theory==
Almost every instance of j.ABC can be replaced with j.CAB and vice versa (This has not tested for every combo so there likely will be exceptions).

Every 236B-6A > X > 236A-B ender can be replaced with 236B-6A > X > 236A-A for a miniscule damage loss in exchange for much better oki and access to IW.

Add level 3 headings to fit various combo situations. -

I have not tested if any of these combos are universal if you find that one of these routes drops constantly on someone contact me on discord (@Redslasher) in the main UNI discord.

Combos were done on Hyde/Linne, all damage numbers are written assuming no vorpal unless the combo requires the use of chain shift (there are none yet).

Do not go for it, it does look really cool tho.

Works from 2AA but you need to use 66B(3) instead of 5B or else the combo will drop, with 2A2B starter combo drops after 236B.
