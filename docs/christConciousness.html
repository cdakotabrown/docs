<p>9w8. social, independent, and routine in behavior. Generally more assertive and adventurous than other 9s because of the 8 wing (type 8s are assertive, headstrong, confident, less requiring external validation.)
9w8s tend to:</p>
<ul>
<li>be afraid of loss and separation</li>
<li>avoid personal confrontation and conflict</li>
<li>be social and adaptable</li>
<li>seek balance and peace in life</li>
<li>use routine to ignore their problems</li>
</ul>
<p>9w8s are typically strong in:</p>
<ul>
<li>encouraging and supporting other people</li>
<li>ability to assert themselves in professional settings</li>
<li>adapting to new ideas or circumstances</li>
<li>connecting with and effectively leading others</li>
<li>seeing multiple perspectives in a situation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="claire">Claire</h2>
<img src="https://cdakotabrown.github.io/docs/pictures/claire.jpg" alt="Claire" width="200"/>
<p>4w5. generally more reserved, eccentric, and perceptive in thought and behavior. your 5 wing makes you more independent and more likely to strive to solve issues on your own.</p>
<p>4w5 general traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative, intellectual, and objective</li>
<li>Seem reserved and withdrawn from others</li>
<li>Want to understand the world</li>
<li>Seek personal impact and identity</li>
<li>Fear having little knowledge or significance</li>
</ul>
<p>4w5 typical strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staying true to who you are</li>
<li>Deeply-rooted curiosity and passion for knowledge</li>
<li>Ability to connect deeply with yourself</li>
<li>Objective and creative problem-solving</li>
</ul>
<p>it's worth noting that you are also extremely high in type 8, which likely makes that your triad. That comes with a lot of self-confidence, etc (read culex's, i put a little bit about type 8 there). So being self-assured and headstrong likely comes from your high type 8 value</p>
<h2 id="baylor">Baylor</h2>
<img src="https://cdakotabrown.github.io/docs/pictures/baylor.png" alt="Baylor" width="200"/>
<p>8w7. You dislike authority. Big fear of being controlled by someone else, and likes to advocate for others when sensing they are losing their autonomy. Wants to be free, defense mechanism is simply to deny vulnerability. Never wants to appear weak and thus avoids situations that leave you defenseless or exposed.</p>
<p>General 8w7 traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advocate for the rights of others</li>
<li>Think practically and creatively</li>
<li>Be afraid of losing their autonomy</li>
<li>Dream big and be idealistic</li>
<li>Struggle to be emotionally honest or vulnerable</li>
</ul>
<p>8w7 strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making logical and fair decisions</li>
<li>Forming connections with others</li>
<li>Creating optimistic and innovative plans</li>
<li>Leading others inspirationally and effectively</li>
<li>Ability to share their thoughts and opinions openly</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very notable that you are very high in type 3, so that's likely your triad. Type 3s are charming and attractive, ambitious, competent, and status-conscious. Overly concerned with image, what others think of you, and being liked. Motivated by external affirmations from others, getting attention, being admired, impressing others. Also wants to be distinguished from others. This being your triad probably gives you a back-of-the-mind crippling fear of not being liked or not reaching your full potential, but your main 8w7 tries to keep it under wraps and it just looks like fashionable narcissism</p>

<p>so im pretty sure you are a type 4 and not a type 8. it's really close tho. So you are either 4w3 or 4w5. Check Claire's write up for a description of 4w5 with 8 triad. i'll explain 4w3 here and basically it's up to you to see what sounds more accurate for you</p>
<p>4w3: Desires uniqueness and personal identity. Fears having no significance in the world, and expresses this by frequently distinguishing themselves from the rest of the world. Has intense bouts of creativity and self-expression provoked by a longing to be authentically different. Defense mechanism may manifest as unconsciously adapting characteristics of others to seem more authentic.</p>
<p>4w3 general traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energetic, distinctive, and driven</li>
<li>Desires significance and legacy</li>
<li>Seeks uniqueness and individuality</li>
<li>Fear having no impact on the world</li>
<li>Engages with those around them</li>
</ul>
<p>4w3 typical strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is deeply in tune with themselves</li>
<li>Understands the feelings and motivations of others</li>
<li>Thinks creatively and efficiently</li>
<li>Consistently genuine and authentic</li>
</ul>
<p>you also are very high in 8. See Claire's description for how this affects you because you both have a 8 as your triad</p>
<h2 id="dakota">Dakota</h2>
<img src="https://cdakotabrown.github.io/docs/pictures/dakota.png" alt="Dakota" width="200"/>
<p>6w7. The confidant. Very loyal, honors commitments very often. 6w7s say what they mean and do what they say. Greatly values feeling safe and supported, which manifests as love and support for others. Greatest fear is losing your support system, which may manifest in self-deprecating humor where others get the opportunity to offer you assurance.</p>
<p>6w7 general traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loves being around people</li>
<li>Afraid of losing sense of security</li>
<li>Makes jokes to deflect and project feelings</li>
<li>Seeks support and assurance from others</li>
<li>Values reliability and trust in relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>6w7 typical strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often dedicates themselves to a cause</li>
<li>Cares deeply for other people</li>
<li>Honors promises and commitments</li>
<li>Is naturally sociable and spirited</li>
</ul>
<p>Noting again your high 8, which i have talked about what an 8 triad means for Claire and it works similarly here. check her write up for how an 8 triad affects your personality. Also, you are high in 1 as well. This gives you a developed sense of morality and wanting to uphold and exemplify humane and &quot;pure&quot; decision making</p>
<h2 id="levi">Levi</h2>
<img src="https://cdakotabrown.github.io/docs/pictures/chef.jpg" alt="Levi" width="200"/>
<p>5w4. Wants to feel helpful and able, expresses this by passionately pursuing knowledge and understanding of the world around you. Defense mechanism is withdrawing, which may cause 5w4s to feel lonely. Biggest fear is not feeling helpful and competent, so there's an overcompensation of seeking knowledge to mitigate this and feel worthy of others.</p>
<p>5w4 basic traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guarded or withdrawn from others</li>
<li>Seeks new skills and knowledge</li>
<li>Curiously explores new environments</li>
<li>Prefers being by themselves</li>
<li>Fears being helpless or incapable</li>
</ul>
<p>5w4 typical strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative thinking and expression</li>
<li>Ability to work well independently</li>
<li>Detail oriented: Observes and understands small details</li>
<li>Deep level of focus and attentiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>Your personality seems well developed, because you are (like everyone else here so far) high in 8. This informs the strengths of your opinions, self worth, and assertiveness. While your 5w4 makes you less sure of yourself and lacking confidence, your 8 triad comes to back you up and keeps you from getting too low on self-idea. You are also high in 1, which suggests you value upholding morals and humane decision making</p>
