        <h1 id="settings-menus-pc">Settings Menus PC</h1>
<p>Core: Immediately going to settings in a game</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>The first thing I do when I boot any game on any platform is go to the settings menu and configure every part. I've been told this is weird but still get upset over how these menus might behave.</p>

<h2 id="meat">Meat</h2>
<h3 id="good-settings-menus">Good Settings Menus</h3>
<p>I want Graphics, I want Gameplay, I want Sound, I want Accessibility, I want Netplay, I want Mod Support, I want controls mapping (NOT MENUS LIKE MVC3). Dota and a lot of modern AAA games do this.</p>
<h3 id="bad-settings-menus">Bad Settings Menus</h3>
<p>Usually poor compared to the good ones, newer PC games on obscure engines fall in here.</p>
<h3 id="ugly-settings-menus">Ugly Settings Menus</h3>
<p>This is where anxiety and incoherent screaming come in. Menus that were likely stapled into the port of a console game or games where there's no menu at all.</p>
<h3 id="avoiding-settings-menus">Avoiding settings menus</h3>
<p>Indie games that don't have settings menus from the start (Hotline Miami, Downwell(?))</p>
<h3 id="gameplay-spoilers-in-settings-menus">Gameplay spoilers in settings menus</h3>
<p>Spitballing:</p>
<p>Imagine there was an accessibility option in Last of Us that said something like &quot;Auto break grabs&quot; or &quot;Auto aim Ellie&quot;, I'd be pissed to know that certain gameplay gimmicks like a grab break system or a completely different playable character are being told to me before I ever even try the core loop out.</p>
<p>Imagine in Nier Automata that there was an &quot;auto target during top down shooter parts&quot; button but you haven't completed the game to the point where you know about that new gameplay gimmick. The start of the game is a top down shooter but there's no targetting, so knowing this would spoil the gameplay twist you're later given.</p>
<p>Imagine Inscryption</p>
<h3 id="narrative-spoilers-in-settings-menus">Narrative spoilers in settings menus</h3>
<h3 id="ux-of-settings-menus">UX of settings menus</h3>
<p>If I have to watch an animation each time something changes I start your game upset. If i have to press a button repeatedly to up a slider my day is ruined.</p>
<h3 id="audio">AUDIO</h3>
<p>FUCK AUDIO SETTINGS</p>
<h3 id="menus">MENUS</h3>
<p>FUCK ANY MENU MORE COMPLEX THAN THE SUPER METROID INVENTORY SCREEN. Breath of the Wild example</p>

<p>Stuff like Skyrim fixes or coomer shit</p>
<h4 id="scripts">Scripts</h4>
<p>Stuff like jump throw binds in CS</p>
