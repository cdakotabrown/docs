<p>[7:36 AM] erin: tbh the ideas in that scene, and particularly that specific &quot;one-way relationship&quot; phrasing, have really informed my approach to a lot of things in hobbies etc
[7:36 AM] erin: embracing &amp; enjoying &quot;not knowing&quot; rather than voraciously trying to learn everything
[7:37 AM] erin: and doing the most to make the learning process itself enjoyable, not just a means to an end
[7:37 AM] erin: cause after all, i only get to learn once
[7:37 AM] erin: this specifically for me in my main hobby, fighting games, but it can apply to a lot of other things too
[7:39 AM] erin: all this to say that umineko has influenced my thinking to the point that it's significantly improved my day-to-day
[7:39 AM] erin: thanks ryukishi</p>

<h3 id="how-these-scenes-usually-play-out-at-the-end-of-higurashi">How these scenes usually play out at the end of Higurashi</h3>
<p>The epilogue chapters in Higurashi are usually called cast review sessions. They serve a couple uses, they allow a small break to decompress after enduring the ending act of an episode. Most of the endings of Higurashi involve tragic endings and many people dying that we've come to know and care about. It's a cheeky &quot;hey don't worry, these characters are fine they are just as confused or anxious or curious as you, the reader, are&quot;. It directly breaks the fourth wall and treats the reader as if they were part of a greater conversation about what's going on in the town of Hinamizawa 1983.
All of the main cast joins the discussion and has their own observations and comments about how to interpret the events of the episode. The confused outsider, Keiichi, might have no idea what the traditions and customs are of the town, but can still draw logical conclusions and comment on the absurdity of a mysterious murder that just took place. Someone more grounded in the background of the town, like Mion, might her talking more in a direction that points to underlying motivations or hints at how the town functions at a politics level. Someone attuned to the town itself as a living organism, like Rena, might have nothing useful to say when it comes to decoding the whodunnit or the howdunnit, but might have a profound take on the whydunnit of a situation. She &quot;gets&quot; the town and recognizes the value of truth and consensus in Hinamizawa specifically.
This review section of Higurashi episodes is not treated as canon events between the characters of the narrative, but instead a meta-narrative device that is used to highlight important moments and hints throughout the story. The personalities of the characters are maintained but their memories are not fluid across the distinct barrier between narrative and meta-narrative.
To simplify talking about these &quot;layers&quot; I'll start referring to them as Level 1 (L1), and Level 2 (L2).<br>
L1 contains all events inside of the narrative presented in the Higurashi VN episodes. Each story of Keiichi moving to town at the start of summer until he and his friends experience a tragedy resulting in death or destruction. Characters that are shackled to this level do not have knowledge of any coexisting chapters.
L2 contains many of the same &quot;characters&quot; that are on L1, but now have meta-narrative knowledge of the events happening on L1. These characters share a personality with their L1 counterpart, but are comfortable existing in an environment where everyone is aware that they're inside of a visual novel. They do not interact with L1, but are able to witness it. R07 has created a book-club of sorts for the viewer interested enough to want to see what the characters of the book think of their roles in the play they've just participated in. The characters don't know what is to come in a future episode, but experienced the play at the same time you, the reader, did. This atmosphere is much less serious than the spicier parts of an average Higurashi episode, playful jabs and mocking someone's lack of understanding of events that unfolded.
Umineko has a good wording for conceptualizing this distinction, game board and player. L1 would be a game board that includes game pieces, L2 includes the players that can interact with the game board.</p>
<p>SPOILERS FOR HIGURASHI: This ends up becoming slightly more complicated once Keiichi remembers something important in Episode 6, and during the Bernkastel fragment game in Episode 8. L1 and L2 start to intermingle near the end of the Higurashi series to show a larger stage that we initially thought was being displayed throughout the early episodes. We are told that a L2 Player known as &quot;Bernkastel&quot; has been attempting to solve the mystery of the L1 Game Board &quot;Hinamizawa 1983&quot; using her Game Piece &quot;Rika&quot;.</p>
<p>The epilogue (tea room) of Umineko Episode 1 starts in a similar fashion to what we're used to from Higurashi epilogues (cast review session). The main protagonists are put into a otherworld environment and start to talk about the events of the episode, as if they are also in the abstract L2 that we've seen before. Battler attempts to speak about the events of the episode logically. Jessica challenges these ideas by playing advocate for the existence of magic and logical inconsistency. Maria plays the role of someone who understands or &quot;gets&quot; what magic and witches are, mocking any attempts to disprove these feelings with cackling laughter or indignant whining.
Everything plays out as it always has in past WTC titles, meta-narrative for the sake of creating a dialogue with the player. A book-club aesthetic to give the player hints at what to look at for solving the mystery of the story, and markers for anyone trying to pinpoint the rules of the Game Board &quot;Rokkenjima 1986&quot;. This would have been just another review chapter if not for the determination of the main protagonist, Battler, to defy any and all attempts to make him concede ground toward the belief that &quot;magic&quot; could have been responsible for any of the events. He denies these claims so much so that the previously unseen witch herself APPEARS before the review session to proclaim she isn't about to take any criticism sitting down. The foundational assumption surrounding this epilogue chapter has changed. L2 is no longer here for the actors in the story to have a conversation with us, the viewer, but instead are talking amongst each other in what is a newly introduced layer of narrative in the story!</p>
<ul>
<li>TODO: Explain why this is cool in comparison to Higurashi here. Like why is it cool to have another layer of meta-narrative stapled onto your story othery than the complexity?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Golden Witch Beatrice has trapped Battler and his family in purgatory until they concede that she and her army of magical servants were fully responsible for the tragedy of &quot;Rokkenjima 1986&quot;. We've been trained by Higurashi to seek the truth and see through deceit. Battler assumes our role in what used to be a meta-narrative between us and R07 told through his stories. This Tea Room scene isn't made to downplay the tragedies of the L1 Game Board, or draw attention to the fact that you're reading a mystery VN. This Tea Room scene is celebrating the relationship R07 has formed with his audience, creating a rival pair of interlocutors that will treat L1/L2 like a battle of wits. This transformation of the epilogue review section is reinforced by Umineko introducing a 2nd epilogue chapter in each episode called ???, in which the ACTUAL meta-narrative characters have conversations about the state of the L1/L2 interactions. These conversations usually serve to draw special attention to the ropes holding the whole show together, providing hints toward how to solve the mysteries of the story in the same vein as the cast review segments of Higurashi.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because YOU are part of that highest &quot;level&quot;. YOU are having a dialogue with the characters as they think about the events of the routes you're reading. Stuff is left in the air and intentionally vague because YOU are supposed to be thinking about alternative solutions to the problems. R07 wants you to embrace and enjoy &quot;not knowing&quot; and come up with ideas/solutions yourself. Enjoy thinking about things instead of being told anything and everything about media or hobbies or whatever. Learn how to learn, and enjoy that learning process, you can only learn a new thing once.</p>
<p>TODO: Fighting games tie in? lol</p>
